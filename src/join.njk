            <p class="is-size-6 mb-4">We welcome inquiries from prospective students and collaborators!

                <p class="is-size-6"><b>Prospective Ph.D. researchers:</b> Ph.D. researchers in the Hogle Lab are admitted through the <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/research/utugs/doctoral-programme-in-biology-geography-and-geology">UTU Doctoral Programme in Biology, Geography and Geology (BGG).</a> Before applying to the program, you need to identify a suitable supervisor (i.e., me) and secure their backing. There are openings for fully funded, 4-year UTU Graduate School doctoral researcher positions every autumn, and I am happy to support competitive applicants in writing a research proposal.</p>
                <p class="is-size-6 mt-4">Ph.D. researchers in the Hogle Lab have the freedom to pursue their own interests. Your Ph.D. thesis topic should ideally align with topics on our <a href="/research">research page</a>, but I encourage you to explore other interests and passions. We are experimentalists at heart, and we are also a very quantitative lab. Knowledge of one or more programming languages (e.g., R or Python) and experience with statistics, data analysis, and applied bioinformatics (especially genomics and metagenomics) is a strong benefit but not an absolute requirement. <em>Most importantly you are independent, creative, a have a strong motivation to learn.</em></p>
