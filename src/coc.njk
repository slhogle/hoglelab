                <p class="is-size-6"><b>All lab members</b> shall adhere to the following code of conduct. Enforcement of the code is ultimately the responsibility of the lab PI (Shane), but all lab members are expected to help create a fun, safe, and productive environment for everyone. Please <a href="mailto:shane.hogle@utu.fi">contact Shane</a> if you have a concern with any topic on this page. If your concern is with Shane's conduct you should contact Shane's supervisor (<a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/university/faculty-of-science/biology/contact">the head of UTU biology department</a>).</p>

                <p class="is-size-6"><b>Occupational health and safety:</b> Everyone in the group shares responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of occupational safety in the lab and the wider department. Each lab member is responsible to familiarize themself with <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/en/employment-and-hr/Pages/occupational-health-and-safety.aspx">occupational safety at UTU.</a> Additionally, all members must read and agree to the UTU Department of Biology rules (<span class="icon-text"><a style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="/pdfs/20211004_UTU_biology_dept_rules.pdf">PDF</a><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i></span></span> - print, sign, and return to Shane). Each of us is responsible for following chemical and biological safety standards and <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/index/safety-instructions-for-emergencies/Pages/default.aspx">all instructions for campus-wide emergencies.</a> Please refer to the <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/index/cheminventory/Pages/default.aspx">UTU Cheminventory database</a> to review any chemical risks when working with a new reagent. Please also refer to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/labs/bmbl/"><em>Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL)</em></a> for safety information related to handling microorganisms. I expect all team members to read <span class="icon-text"><a style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="/pdfs/BMBL6.pdf">BMBL-6, sections I-IV</a><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i></span></span>. We work at Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1), which is the lowest risk category. BSL-1 labs follow Standard Microbiological Practices (<span class="icon-text"><a style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="/pdfs/BMBL6.pdf">BMBL-6, section III</a><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i></span></span>), require no special features beyond standard laboratory equipment, and are safely equipped to handle organisms or toxins not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adults. Work in BSL-1 labs has minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. Occupational safety also applies to those of us doing office or computational work. <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/index/ergonomic-instructions/Pages/default.aspx">Please mind your office ergonomics!</a> If your desk and chair are insufficient you should talk to the faculty of science representative <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/index/occupational-safety/Pages/default.aspx">from UTU Occupational Health and Safety</a> and the <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/university/faculty-of-science/biology/contact">Vice Heads of the Biololgy Deparment.</a> Please know that your health and safety are more important to me than your research!</p>

            <div class="block">
                <p class="is-size-6"><b>Harrassment, bullying, discrimination, and other inappropriate behaviors:</b> Our community is open to all regardless of their ethnic or national origin, race, religion, citizenship, language, political or other opinion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, or economic class, and discrimination based on these characteristics will not be tolerated. We also do not tolerate harrassment/bullying in any form (including <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/advancegeo/resources/microaggressions.html">microagressions</a>). Some examples of inappropriate conduct include, but are not limited to, sexual language or imagery, racially or culturally offensive comments, touching of hair or clothing or the body without permission, threatening, humiliating, coercive, or otherwise intimidating behaviors. More examples <a href="https://intranet.utu.fi/index/early-support-for-employees-and-work-communities/Pages/Bullying-and-Harassment.aspx">are available here.</a> If you encounter these behaviors you should confront the perpetrator and tell them to stop. You should also <a href="mailto:shane.hogle@utu.fi">notify the PI</a> about the incident. The PI maintains the right remove repeat offenders from the lab group at any time. In general we commit to maintaining the highest level of respect and professionalism towards others in our communtiy. We provide honest, fair, and constructive criticism to each other as necessary. When disagreements arise they are handled in good faith and without personal attacks. We strive to manage conflict and disagreement proactively and openly towards resolution without resentment or bitterness.</p>

                <p class="is-size-6"><b>Research integrity:</b> We adhere to the University of Turku <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/research/ethics">guidelines for research ethics</a>. It is the responsibility of all lab members to familiarize themselves with the <a href="https://tenk.fi/en/research-integrity-ri">The Finnish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity and Procedures for Handling Alleged Violations of Research Integrity</a> and adhere to the code. Additionally, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of scientific rigour and honesty, which in practice means that we document our projects and thinking clearly and thoroughly, we ensure raw data is documented, backed-up, and immutable, we use reproducible scientific notebooks (e.g., <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> or <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>) for data analysis, we release research data and code from our publications into the public domain, we follow <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR data</a> principles when publishing our raw data, and we release all of our papers as preprints (e.g., on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>) prior to publication.</p>
