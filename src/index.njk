                We are a research group in the <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/university/faculty-of-science/biology">Biology Department</a> 
                at the <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en">University of Turku, Finland</a>.

                <p class="is-size-6 mb-4">
                We seek to understand how microorganisms (we have worked with bacteria, ciliates, nematodes, and phytoplankton) interact and how those interaction networks change through time. We are particularly interested in how microbial community dynamics and concurrent evolutionary processes scale to influence community function and, more broadly, fluxes of matter and energy through whole ecosystems. Our work spans a diversity of scales ranging from the cellular to the global, and we employ a plurality of methodologies, including those from classic microbiology, molecular biology, cell physiology, bioinformatics, data science, and modeling. Our collaborative group works with mathematical ecologists, biogeochemical modelers, chemists, and environmental scientists.
